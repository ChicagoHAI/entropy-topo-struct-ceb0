## Main Claim

For any mathematical solution space $S$ with topological invariant $\tau(S)$ and creativity entropy $H(S)$, the probability $P(\mathcal{N})$ of generating a novel mathematical structure $\mathcal{N}$ satisfying quality threshold $q$ is bounded by: $P(\mathcal{N}) \leq \exp(-\alpha H(S)) + \beta\tau(S)$ where $\alpha, \beta > 0$ are domain-specific constants

## Supporting Lemmas

1. Lemma 1: The creativity entropy $H(S)$ of a mathematical solution space $S$ satisfies $H(S) \geq \log(|\mathcal{B}(S)|)$ where $\mathcal{B}(S)$ is the basis set of fundamental mathematical structures in $S$
2. Lemma 2: For any quality threshold $q \in [0,1]$, the set of high-quality structures $S_q = \{x \in S : Q(x) \geq q\}$ forms a closed subspace with $\tau(S_q) \leq \tau(S)$
3. Lemma 3: The probabilistic kernel $K(x,y)$ measuring similarity between mathematical structures satisfies $\int_S K(x,y)dy \leq \exp(-\gamma d(x,\mathcal{B}(S)))$ where $d$ is the structural distance metric
4. Lemma 4: The topological invariant $\tau(S)$ bounds the maximum number of disjoint novel structures: $|\{\mathcal{N}_i\}| \leq \beta\tau(S)$ for any set of novel structures $\{\mathcal{N}_i\}$ with pairwise distance $d(\mathcal{N}_i,\mathcal{N}_j) > \epsilon$

## Proof Strategy

1) Use Lemma 1 to establish lower bound on entropy of solution space
2) Apply Lemma 2 to restrict to high-quality subspace
3) Use kernel bounds from Lemma 3 to analyze probability of generating structures at different distances from basis
4) Apply topological bounds from Lemma 4 to novel structure density
5) Combine bounds using union bound and optimize constants

## Validation Approach

1) Implement numerical simulation of mathematical structure generation process using established creativity frameworks
2) Calculate empirical probabilities for different solution spaces (e.g. graph theory, number theory)
3) Compare theoretical bounds to empirical results across varying entropy and topological complexity levels
4) Validate on real mathematical discovery datasets from published literature
