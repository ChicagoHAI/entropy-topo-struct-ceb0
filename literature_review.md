# Literature Review

## Background

Mathematical creativity research has evolved to incorporate rigorous quantitative frameworks for analyzing novel idea generation. Building on Varshney's (2019) work on limit theorems, creativity can be formally modeled as a stochastic process where novel mathematical structures emerge from combinations of existing knowledge representations. The fundamental theorems establish probability bounds on generating ideas that satisfy both novelty and quality constraints within a given mathematical domain.

The formalization draws on computational thinking paradigms, where creative problem-solving is decomposed into measurable components including relational thinking skills (Usodo et al. 2020) and parametric optimization (Selvi 2025). Key metrics include entropy-based measures of originality, topological characteristics of solution spaces, and probabilistic distance measures between existing and novel mathematical structures. Recent work by Tunçeli et al. (2025) has extended these frameworks to early mathematical development, providing evidence for the emergence of creative computational thinking.

The mathematical foundations incorporate elements from information theory, topology, and dynamical systems to quantify and analyze creative processes. Central concepts include entropy measures H(x) for novelty assessment, topological invariants τ(S) of solution spaces S, and probabilistic kernels K(x,y) measuring similarity between mathematical structures. These allow for rigorous analysis of both human and computational creative processes in mathematics.
